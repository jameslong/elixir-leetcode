# Problem 18: 4Sum

## Approach
This solution reduces 4Sum to 3Sum by fixing the first element and solving 3Sum for the remaining elements with an adjusted target. The approach reuses the optimized 3Sum solution with minor tweaks:

1. Sort the array and convert to tuple for O(1) access
2. For each element `i`, fix it as the first element of the quadruplet
3. Solve 3Sum for elements from `i+1` to end with target = `original_target - nums[i]`
4. The 3Sum solution uses the same two-pointer technique with duplicate skipping
5. Early termination when current element > 0 and > target (for positive targets)

The key insight is that 4Sum can be decomposed into multiple 3Sum problems, and 3Sum can be decomposed into multiple 2Sum problems using the two-pointer technique.

## Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(n³) - one loop for fixing first element, nested 3Sum is O(n²)
- Space Complexity: O(1) excluding the output array

## Key Insights
- Reusing the 3Sum solution makes the code cleaner and more maintainable
- Converting to tuple after sorting provides O(1) element access
- Early termination optimization: if current element > 0 and > target, no need to continue
- Duplicate skipping at each level prevents duplicate quadruplets
- The pattern extends naturally: 5Sum would fix one element and solve 4Sum, etc.
