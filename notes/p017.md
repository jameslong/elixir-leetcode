# Problem 17: Letter Combinations of a Phone Number

## Approach
The key optimization leverages the constraint that the input length is at most 4 digits. Instead of using recursion or dynamic programming, we can use pattern matching to handle each case (0-4 digits) explicitly:

1. Empty string: return empty list
2. Single digit: return the letters for that digit
3. Two digits: use list comprehension with 2 nested iterations
4. Three digits: use list comprehension with 3 nested iterations  
5. Four digits: use list comprehension with 4 nested iterations

This approach avoids the overhead of recursive calls and provides optimal performance for the constrained input size.

## Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(4^n) where n is the length of digits (max 4)
- Space Complexity: O(4^n) for the output list

## Key Insights
- The constraint that digits.length â‰¤ 4 allows us to unroll the recursion completely
- Pattern matching on binary strings (<<digit>>) is more efficient than string manipulation
- List comprehensions in Elixir compile to efficient nested loops
- Using character codes (?2, ?3, etc.) for pattern matching is faster than string comparison
