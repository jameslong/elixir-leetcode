# Problem 19: Remove Nth Node From End of List

## Approach
This solution uses the two-pointer technique (slow and fast pointers) to solve the problem in a single pass:

1. Start with both `fast` and `slow` pointers at the head
2. Move the `fast` pointer n steps ahead first
3. Then move both pointers together until `fast` reaches the end
4. When `fast` is null, `slow` is at the node before the one to remove
5. Skip the next node by reconstructing the list without it

The recursive implementation:
- Uses an index counter to track when fast pointer is n steps ahead
- When fast reaches end (nil), returns slow.next (skipping the current slow node)
- Otherwise, reconstructs the list node by node

## Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(n) - single pass through the list
- Space Complexity: O(n) - due to recursion stack

## Key Insights
- The two-pointer technique eliminates the need for a second pass
- Performance on LeetCode is equivalent to the double-pass approach (get length, then remove nth from start)
- The recursive solution is more elegant than iterative but uses O(n) space
- The key insight: maintain a gap of n nodes between two pointers
- Edge case handled naturally: when removing the head node, fast becomes nil after n steps
