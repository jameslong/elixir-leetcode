# Problem 020: Valid Parentheses

## Approach
Use a stack to track opening brackets:
1. Iterate through each character in the string
2. Push opening brackets onto the stack
3. For closing brackets, check if they match the most recent opening bracket
4. String is valid if we process all characters and the stack is empty

## Complexity
- Time: O(n) - single pass through the string
- Space: O(n) - worst case stack size when all characters are opening brackets
