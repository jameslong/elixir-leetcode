Marked as 'hard' on Leetcode, however the desired O(log (m+n)) solution is not possible with Elixir, as we don't have constant time lookup for lists.

**Two pass approach:**
- O(m + n) as we traverse each list once to build to combined list, then traverse the result

Note, the best solution to this problem depends on the Leetcode private test set - lots of faster optimisations only make sense for long lists, and for real code, it will be faster, and simpler to stick to regular lists without the tuple conversion.

This submission is #1 on Leetcode. ðŸŽ‰
