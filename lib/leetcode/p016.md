# Problem 16: 3Sum Closest

## Approach

This problem uses a very similar approach to Problem 15 (3Sum):
1. Sort the array and convert to tuple for O(1) access
2. Use three pointers: fix one element and use two pointers for the remaining elements
3. Move pointers based on whether current sum is less than or greater than target
4. Track the closest sum found so far

The key difference from 3Sum is that we're finding the closest sum rather than exact matches.

### Early-Out Optimizations

Early-out optimizations are particularly effective for this problem:
- If target > 3000: Return sum of three largest elements (since max element is 1000, max sum is 3000)
- If target < -3000: Return sum of three smallest elements (since min element is -1000, min sum is -3000)
- Initialize closest based on target sign for better starting bound

## Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: O(nÂ²) - For each element, we perform a two-pointer search
- Space Complexity: O(n) - For the sorted tuple

## Key Insights

- Early-out optimizations provide significant performance gains by immediately handling extreme targets
- Skip duplicate values for the first pointer to avoid redundant calculations
- Similar two-pointer technique as 3Sum, but tracking closest distance instead of exact matches
- Using tuples instead of lists provides faster element access in the inner loops
