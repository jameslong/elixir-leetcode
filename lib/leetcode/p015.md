# Problem 015 - 3Sum

## Problem Description
Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0. The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

## Approach
1. **Sort and Convert**: First sort the array and convert to tuple for O(1) access
2. **Outer Loop**: Iterate through each element as the first number of potential triplets
3. **Two Pointers**: For each fixed first element, use two pointers (left and right) to find pairs that sum to the negative of the first element
4. **Skip Duplicates**: Skip duplicate values for both the outer loop and the two-pointer search to avoid duplicate triplets
5. **Early Termination**: If the current element is positive, we can stop since the array is sorted and no three positive numbers can sum to zero

## Complexity
- Time: O(nÂ²) - We have an outer loop O(n) and for each iteration, the two-pointer search is O(n)
- Space: O(n) - The tuple conversion uses O(n) space, not counting the output

## Notes
- The solution cleverly uses tuple conversion for faster element access compared to lists
- The `grow_from_left` and `shrink_from_right` helper functions efficiently skip duplicates during the two-pointer search
- Early termination when `val_i > 0` is a nice optimization since sorted positive numbers can't sum to zero
- The algorithm handles duplicates by:
  - Skipping duplicate values in the outer loop (line 28 check)
  - Skipping duplicate values after finding a valid triplet (lines 54-55)
