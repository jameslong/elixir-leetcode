# Discussion

This is an infuriating problem, as the runtime measurement on Leetcode is not reliable. E.g. The 'best' submission has a listed runtime of 274ms (beats 100%), however if you copy-paste that *exact* code and resubmit, you get a runtime of 357ms (beats 6%). Presumably the Elixir runtime performance on Leetcode was significantly better when the original submission was made.

Anyway ðŸ˜„, the key constraint with this problem is 'assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers'. This obviously isn't possible with Elixir, however there are a few viable approaches we can take. The first solution I considered is to recursively extract the last digit `rem(x, 10)` and then divide by 10, accumulating the result as you go. However, it turns out this is slower than using String/Integer operations, presumably because the built in functions are faster than all the required arithmetic.

i.e. We have (simplified to remove sign correction etc):

```elixir
# Compute directly via recursive fucntion
defp reverse(x, reversed) do
  reverse(div(x, 10), reversed * 10 + rem(x, 10))
end

# String manipulation (faster)
defp reverse(x) do
  x
  |> Integer.to_string()
  |> String.reverse()
  |> String.to_integer()
end

# Integer operation (fastest)
def reverse(x) do
  x
  |> Integer.digits()
  |> Enum.reverse()
  |> Integer.undigits()
end
```

This follows the general rule that BIFs (built-in functions) are normally much faster than handwritten code - BIFs are implemented in C, and are often highly optimised.
