There are a few approaches here, but the quickest avoids converting the number to a list/string.

The key insights are:

1. **Negative numbers are never palindromes** - they have a leading minus sign
2. **Numbers ending in 0 are only palindromes if they are 0 itself** - no palindrome can start with 0 except 0
3. **We only need to reverse half the digits** - once the reversed portion equals or exceeds the remaining portion, we can determine if it's a palindrome

The algorithm works by:
- Extracting the last digit with `rem(x, 10)` and adding it to our reversed accumulator
- Reducing the original number by dividing by 10
- Continuing until `x < reversed` (odd length) or `x == reversed` (even length)

For odd-length numbers like 12321:
- We stop when x=12 and reversed=123
- The middle digit (3) can be ignored, so we check if x == div(reversed, 10)

For even-length numbers like 1221:
- We stop when x=12 and reversed=12
- We check if x == reversed

This solution is O(log n) time complexity (note, this is where n is the input number - n is *not* the number of digits), and is currently the #1 Elixir solution on Leetcode. ðŸŽ‰
