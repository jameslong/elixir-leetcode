Note, I originally solved this using recursion, but then saw that there was a built-in function for this exact purpose! ðŸ˜„

The solution simply:
1. Uses `:binary.longest_common_prefix/1` to get the length of the common prefix
2. Extracts that prefix from the first string using `:binary.part/3`

This approach is both the most concise and most performant solution, demonstrating the power of using the right BIF for the job. The entire algorithm is implemented in a single line of meaningful code.
