# Discussion

The "Roman to Integer" problem is the inverse of p012, and like its counterpart, benefits significantly from Elixir's pattern matching capabilities and the constrained input space.

The key insights are:

1. **Subtractive cases must be handled first** - patterns like "IV", "IX", "XL" need to be matched before their individual components
2. **Pattern matching eliminates complex logic** - we can directly match string prefixes rather than analyzing character relationships
3. **Greedy left-to-right parsing works** - since Roman numerals follow strict formation rules, we can consume the longest matching pattern first
4. **Tail recursion with accumulator** - builds the result efficiently while consuming the string

## Optimizations Applied

This solution achieves O(n) time complexity where n is the string length, with O(1) space complexity (excluding recursion stack). The pattern matching approach is both more readable and more performant than character-by-character analysis methods.

This solution currently beats 100% of other Elixir submissions on Leetcode.
