Marked as 'medium' on Leetcode, but it was quite tough to get the fastest time.

This is a [variable size sliding window](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/window-sliding-technique/) problem. The key optimization is using a **bitmask instead of a Map** for tracking seen characters:

**Map approach:**
- O(log n) lookup/insert operations  
- Stores character positions, enabling direct jumps
- Simpler logic: `new_left = previous_position + 1`

**Bitmask approach:**
- O(1) lookup/insert operations
- Only stores seen characters, but not their positions
- Complex two-phase shrinking when duplicates found

The bitmask's O(1) operations outweigh the extra traversal cost, especially for the frequent lookups in this algorithm.

Other notes:

- **Backward traversal:** Sliding the window from right to left (end of string to front) simplifies the code by removing the need to pass the string length as an argument
- **Function privacy:** Marking `shrink_left` and `shrink_right` as private saved 1ms on Leetcode, perhaps because the compiler can inline the functions when it knows they won't be called from elsewhere
- **Character mapping:** Subtracting 32 (`?\s`) from codepoints when writing to the bitmask is a probabilistic optimisation, which increases the chance that the bitmask is a 'small integer'

Note, this submission is currently joint #1 on Leetcode and was inspired by the pre-existing #1 submission. ðŸŽ‰
