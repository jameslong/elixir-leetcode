# Discussion

Regular expression matching is a classic dynamic programming problem, and this implementation uses several optimizations to achieve better performance than a naive recursive solution.

The key insights are:

1. **The `*` operator is the main complexity** - it can match zero or more of the preceding character, requiring us to try multiple possibilities
2. **Overlapping subproblems exist** - the same string/pattern combinations are evaluated multiple times in the recursion tree
3. **Memoization is essential** - caching results for `{string_index, pattern_index}` pairs prevents exponential time complexity
4. **We can optimize character access** - using indexed lookups instead of string slicing

The algorithm works by:
- Using memoization to cache results for `{string_index, pattern_index}` pairs
- Pre-calculating string lengths once to avoid repeated `byte_size/1` calls
- Using `:binary.at/2` for constant-time character access instead of string slicing
- Handling the `*` case by trying both "zero matches" and "one or more matches" branches

## Trade-offs

**Advantages**:
- Significantly faster than naive recursive approaches
- Handles complex patterns efficiently

**Downsides**:
- Code is less readable than a pure recursive solution
- The optimized version is uglier and harder to understand
- More complex state management with the memoization map

This solution achieves O(m×n) time complexity where m and n are the lengths of the string and pattern respectively, with O(m×n) space for memoization.

This solution is currently #1 for Elixir solutions - mainly thanks to memoization.
