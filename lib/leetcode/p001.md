This is a nice problem for Elixir, as the list can be iterated in order, and the solution is recursive.

**Brute force** (comparing every number with every other number):
- Runtime: O(nÂ²)
- Space: O(1)

**Hash map optimization** (this solution) trades space for speed:
- Runtime: O(n) - single pass through the array
- Space: O(n) - storing up to n key-value pairs in the map

Note, this submission is currently #2 on Leetcode, however #1 uses an ETS table, which adds complexity, for only a minor performance gain.
