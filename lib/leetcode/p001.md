This is a nice problem for Elixir, as the list can be iterated in order, and the solution is recursive.

The optimisation here is mainly algorithmic - trading space for speed, by using a map to cache previously seen values.

Note, this solution is currently #2 on Leetcode, however #1 uses an ETS table, which adds complexity, for only a minor performance gain.
