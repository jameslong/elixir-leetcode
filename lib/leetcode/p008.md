This is one of those odd problems which is marked as 'Medium' difficulty on Leetcode, but is incredibly simple to implement. A single pass, with some recursion + pattern matching, solves this in a few lines of code.

This solution is O(n) runtime, and takes '0ms' on Leetcode, beating 100% of other Elixir submissions.
