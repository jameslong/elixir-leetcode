# Discussion

There are a few 'easier' solutions to this problem, and my first instinct was to use a grid. Luckily it's possible to solve with a single pass - the key insight being that the zigzag pattern forms a repeating cycle.

For each cycle, in each row, there are either 1 or two characters added to the row. The formulae for the indices is as follows:

- First character (always added): row + cycle * cycle_len
- Second character (only added for 'middle rows'): (cycle + 1) * cycle_len - row

**Single pass:**
- O(n), a single pass to generate each row

Optimisations are mainly due to the fact that we don't have to worry about unicode characters:

- lookups on the original string using `:binary.at/2` to avoid list/tuple conversion 
- flattening the row lists using `IO.iodata_to_binary/1`

This solution beats all other (Elixir) solutions on Leetcode by a significant margin.
