This was a bit tricky, despite being marked as 'medium'. In particular, the naive solution is very sub-optimal, and this problem doesn't play to Elixir's strengths.

**Brute force:**
- O(n³), we traverse every character, then all possible substrings starting with it, then reverse to determine if the substring is a palindrome

**'Expand from centre' approach:**
- Runtime: O(n²)

Note, there is a further (significant) optimisation using [Manacher's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_palindromic_substring), however this makes the code more complex, and wasn't required to beat 100% of existing Elixir solutions on Leetcode.
