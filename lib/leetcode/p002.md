# Discussion

This is somewhat contrived problem for Elixir, given that the language has in-built linked lists.

**Single pass** (this solution):
- Runtime: O(max(m, n)) - where m and n are the lengths of each input NodeList 
- Space: O(max(m, n))

Note, this submission is currently #2 on Leetcode, however the implementation matches #1 exactly. There is some minor variation in runtime on Leetcode which could explain the difference.
