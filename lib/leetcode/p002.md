This is a somewhat contrived problem for Elixir, given that the language has in-built linked lists.

**Single pass** (this solution):
- Runtime: O(max(m, n)) - where m and n are the lengths of each input ListNode 
- Space: O(max(m, n))

Note, we added an extra optimisation here to handle the case where the lists have different lengths.
