# Discussion

The "Integer to Roman" problem is a perfect example of when a lookup table approach significantly outperforms algorithmic solutions due to the constrained input space.

The key insights are:

1. **Limited input range enables precomputation** - with only 3999 possible inputs, we can precompute all possible digit combinations
2. **Decimal place separation** - each digit position (ones, tens, hundreds, thousands) can be handled independently  
3. **Pattern matching is faster than loops** - Elixir's pattern matching provides O(1) lookup for each digit position
4. **String concatenation is efficient** - building the result by concatenating precomputed strings avoids complex logic

The algorithm works by:
- Extracting each decimal digit using `div` and `rem` operations
- Pattern matching each digit (0-9) to its corresponding Roman numeral representation
- Concatenating the results for thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones places
- Handling all special cases (4, 9, 40, 90, 400, 900) directly in the lookup tables

## Why lookup tables work so well here

**Constraint advantage**: The upper bound of 3999 means we only need 10 patterns per decimal place (0-9), making lookup tables both feasible and fast.

**Eliminates branching logic**: Instead of complex if-else chains to handle subtractive notation (IV, IX, XL, etc.), each case is handled directly by pattern matching.

**Constant time complexity**: Each digit lookup is O(1), making the entire conversion O(1) regardless of input size.

This solution achieves O(1) time complexity with O(1) space complexity, making it significantly more efficient than general-purpose Roman numeral conversion algorithms that would work for larger input ranges.

This solution currently beats 100% of other Elixir submissions on Leetcode.
