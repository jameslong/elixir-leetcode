# Discussion

This is one of those Leetcode problems where the optimal solution isn't immediately obvious. The brute force approach is O(nÂ²), and there are a few key insights required to get to the single pass solution involving left/right pointers:

1. **The area is constrained by the shorter line** - water level is determined by `min(height[i], height[j])`
2. **Width decreases as you move 'inwards' from either end** - area = `height Ã— width`, so we want to maximize both
3. **Moving the taller pointer is never optimal** - it can only decrease the area since the shorter line still constrains the height
4. **Always move the shorter pointer** - this gives us the best chance to find a taller line that could increase the area

The algorithm works by:
- Starting with the widest possible container (leftmost and rightmost lines)
- Calculating the current area and tracking the maximum
- Moving the pointer at the shorter line inward
- Continuing until the pointers meet

## Optimizations Applied

**Tuple conversion**: Converting the list to a tuple provides O(1) indexed access instead of O(n) list traversal for each element lookup.

This solution achieves O(n) time complexity with O(1) extra space (after tuple conversion), making it significantly more efficient than the brute force O(nÂ²) approach of checking all possible pairs.

Note, this solution currently beats 100% of Elixir submissions, with a runtime of 6ms. ðŸŽ‰
